# 談 2019 年與往後的遊戲製作
## 講者：Jonathan Blow


(備註：Jonathan Blow在確定要來當講者後，有開一個表單向大家收集問題，所以本次講座會比較接近Q&A的形式。)

- Q:你的前兩款遊戲都用了數年的時間來完成，請問你是怎麼處理開發過程中的起伏？
  - 在我開發《Braid》的那段時間裡，不斷有人在爭議說「遊戲不可能成為一種藝術」，但我始終相信是有可能的。
  - 我用最簡單、基礎的Platformer作為開頭，並且透過無限制時間倒轉(不是只倒轉一下下，而是可以一路回播到最開始，這很重要)的機制，想讓玩家在遊玩過程中有一種「事情開始不太對勁」的感覺
  - 遊戲在很早期就有可玩版，但是只有「程式美術」程度。由於我是以發售這款遊戲為目標，所以我勢必需要尋找專業的美術夥伴加入開發。

  - 但當時的環境有些複雜：
      - 1.大家覺得2D遊戲的市場已經趨近死亡了
      - 2.很少人相信獨立遊戲這條路行得通
      - 3.很難說服3D美術放棄原本的工作來跟我合作
  - 在尋找與美術夥伴的合作機會時，我收到了一封評價很負面的長內容E-mail，這位美術設計師覺得我的遊戲機制很怪、不符合遊戲業長久以來的公式、感覺很難賺錢。 
  - 在Independent games festival 2006贏得遊戲設計獎項
  - 初次嘗試在Steam發行時，收到平台的回絕。
      - Steam: "This game will sell less than 5000 copies."
      - 那時Steam上幾乎只充斥著3A遊戲，他們對獨立遊戲其實也不太樂觀。
  - 然而我並沒有因此而放棄，因為我的朋友理解、且享受這款遊戲，即使是在非常早期的版本。
  - 我另外認識一個人在Value工作，在我的上架申請被Steam回絕後，他去幫我向Steam的人宣傳說：「我認識Jonathan 這個人，相信我，這是一款好遊戲，你們玩玩看吧！」然而，得到的回饋是：「這款遊戲太難了。」、「獨立遊戲賣得不好。」
  - 處理發售的同時訂下的目標：獲得2007年的IGF Game of The Year !
      - 結果：連最終決選都沒有進...
  - 最終我們在XBOX Live的Summer of arcade發售,但被官方威脅要下架，美術外包也拒絕繼續合作。
  - 我忍不住想說：「哈哈！那些(不看好我的)人是錯的！」，但這其實沒有建設性。
  - 其實要讓別人理解你的遊戲最後會怎麼樣真的很困難，尤其是你的遊戲很奇怪的話，即使那是他的工作。
  - 人們的判斷非常仰賴過往的案例，所以如果你做出了一個不曾出現過的東西，大家就會趨於保守。

- Q:你對Top-Down視角的遊戲設計有什麼看法？以及你如何看待閉門造車 vs頻繁向玩家互動、收集回饋這件事？
  - 多聽別人的想法是好的，尤其是如果你才剛開始接觸遊戲開發這件事。 
  - 然而也不見得完全是好事，開發者還是要有自己的堅持。

- Q:以設計《The Witness》這種有很多層抽象概念的遊戲來說，你認為在想法的迭代中成本最高的事情是什麼？
  - 讓大家理解你的遊戲是很難的...即使他們就在你的開發團隊裡面！ 
  - 有些遊戲設計的「靈魂」是很難用言語表達的。例如：玩家在一個接著一個的謎題中穿梭時，這個遊戲希望給玩家什麼樣的感受？
  - 過程中會有很多次來回的溝通成本
  - 《The Witness》的場景美術有請到建築師來幫忙設計，但由於很多建築師實際上是沒在玩遊戲的...向他們傳達遊戲的理解也是一個困難點。
  - 開發遊戲的過程就是基於對「這款遊戲將來會變成什麼樣」的理解，不斷地推進進度。


- 正在製作的遊戲： 3D puzzle game
  - 介紹對美術風格的摸索 (很多圖)
  - 遊戲核心機制：推方塊(block-pushing)


- Q:身為Game Director，你是如何判斷遊戲裡的美術有達到你的需求？
  - 當我發現角色的風格和場景設計的風格不搭時，我會去分析：是開發製程的問題？溝通的問題？還是設計文件撰寫的問題？
  - 要有一個認知：遊戲裡的任何元素都會影響其他東西，不論是好的還是壞的方向。
  - Art Direction may be able to bridge this.可能是單一元素問題，也可能是組合上的問題。
  - 即使是在3A遊戲團隊裡面，美術風格搭不上也是很常發生的事情。
  - 然而，有個更根本的問題：判定「美術風格是否適合(fit)」本身就是很困難的事情。
  - 這個artist真的比其他人差？還是只是剛好不適合你的遊戲？
  - 美術會透過練習而對你的遊戲美術風格越來越在行
  - 但練習會進步這回事，只建立在你有持續跟美術溝通，讓他們知道什麼做對什麼不對
  - 當有人說他們理解了，對你來說這個理解的程度可能依舊不夠，不一定是真的了解。
  - 在開發的最初期，大部分的事情都會不順遂，別抱有太大期待。
  - 我認為最重要的是：不要過度自卑或自大，這會讓你變得很難溝通。
  - 但有時反而會給出更明確的目標與改善方式

- Q:你是如何篤定你的創新玩法會被大眾所接受？還是每一次都是在賭博？
  -  (沒聽到...)

- Q:Lucas Pope在針對《Return of the Obra Dinn》的訪談中提到，如果你的遊戲夠好，自然就會產生一定的聲量。你覺得這對沒有知名遊戲紀錄的開發者來說，是正確的嗎？
  - 你必須對市場現實有所認知，但如果過度的擔憂這件事，只會讓你做出跟其他人差不多的東西。無論如何這都是很困難的，但請別感到驚慌。
  - 你可能會失敗，我的第一個遊戲公司也失敗了...以財務方面來說。然而，它成功地教會我如何寫程式、如何設計、以及讓我把自己放到一個可以做得更好的位置。
  - 有太多人去做簡單的事情了。我們需要更多人去嘗試困難的事情、探索未知的領域。
  - 
- Q:現在在市面上有許多遊戲引擎，身為遊戲開發的新手我該怎麼做?
  - 表層知識vs深層知識
  - 有些事情可能在2年後、5年後就會變得不重要，可以不用太在意他們
  - 深層知識，例如：圖像的每個pixel是怎麼被渲染在螢幕上？Shader是如何運作的？玩家在發現一道新謎題時，心裡產生了哪些感受變化？

## 現場Q&A

- Q1: 你提到：「讓別人理解你的遊戲是很難的，即使他們就在團隊裡面。」那麼，你有什麼建議能讓團隊成員「理解這款遊戲的設計」的成本降至最小？
  - Answer: 我的很多建議都是針對特定遊戲的，其實很難給出普世的建議。然而，如果其中一方嘗試著去理解另一方為什麼會這樣解讀遊戲，這對整個團隊來說都是會有幫助的。

- Q2: 這題比較針對《The Witness》。我最近才剛開始玩《The Witness》，我其實有些困惑，這是個puzzle game，但又結合探索...總之有很多層抽象的概念。我就在想，如果我是發行商，我一定會覺得這種遊戲很難賣。所以我想知道，你在發想的最初，是如何確保這款遊戲的idea會受到大家肯定？
  - Answer: Well...(嘆一口氣)這就是遊戲設計師的工作。 

- Q3: 你對於在設計的過程中「取得故事、遊戲設計之間的平衡」有什麼看法？
  - Answer: 我其實不喜歡把遊戲裡的故事看得太重。並不是我要否定這件事，而是說故事有分很多元素，最直觀的就是一個序列的事件，除此之外還有氛圍營造、角色設定...這些都是直接鑽研的地方。


後面那行要怎麼翻譯ㄋ
behind closed doors vs. more reactive design in the open?
可能是：閉門造車 vs 公開與玩家互動收集回饋
好難翻 我也是想類似的

**主講者**
you know the title of this talk is making games in 2019 and beyond. Collecting questions beforehand. You can make a comment later. Good morning. The usual sometimes people hear that. So I thought I would start by saying something about the past to help explain why I have the opinions that I have. 
   
   And one of the questions the first question very conveniently asked about the past. It was both of your previous games bring in the witness took years to come. Can you tell us what was it? Let's talk. This is a game that a lot of people have heard of. Uh, it's one of them were recognized in the games from the time it came out uh, and. Oh wait, you know if gone fine, right? Everybody must have always known this was a good game. You know people were waiting for it to come out or something. No problem. You know it doesn't tend to consider. Sorry, first, the basic idea of the game, which stayed consistent. It was that we give the player the ability to rewind and undo their mistakes. And that very general. It's not tied to a resource or you know you don't run out of rewind and then die. There had been a couple of games before brady did rewind, but they all did it in a way that may be more complicated but not different. It was like, oh, you ran out of the wind and how you die. And the idea. In change. If it's no longer about you worry about dying and it's about well we don't know where to start. And you will go between them. And the time we behave differently in all the different world puzzle are actually based the reliability, right which is different from. You can imagine a game. It's like, oh, I'm trying to solve puzzles. And uh mr. John and I always rewind back in. It's convenient, but that's not what this game is. Right? The game is about realizing uh things about the wait time in the way you are. Wait, I'm here to solve the puzzles. So if the puzzles did it make you understand something new or think about something new then they don't go in. Was done with a very um artistic attitude. You know this game came out in 2008. I started working on it in 2005. The idea that games could be art was actually very controversial. Um, most people said no games can be art. There was a small kid. I'm just saying that games are art in the way that you can today. And so I always thought of putting my hat in. Very deliberate game. And uh finally, why was it a platformer and especially why was it a simple platform? Around with reality. If you're going to do all these complicated times stuff. We're not going well, then you actually need a simple situation to start. So I use this classic super mario brothers. Hands off his head. And that's so simple that when things start getting weird, easier for you to. Very deliberately and carefully thought out really during the early phase of development. Like the game is a combination of all these ideas, right? If you just took one of them, space reality is your one idea. You get like every platformer, right? Or if you say, well, it's just got rewind, but it doesn't have puzzles or whatever, you would get a very, very different game. So all of these ideas were required to make the game. And I have a playable very early back then, it was actually not that common to have a game played earlier. We usually take toward the end of development before you can play it. But I had it playable in the first week and just kept making it bigger and more complicated. And it was as if in game design, it was the best program. Time to make it look nice yet i'd like to show you. What's going on, which is probably a little too dark to really see anything, but that's what it's like in the game as well. First screen that you play. Scribbling in program is different pieces. Like. Uh, here's a leader, a boss. You may recognize this. If you play the actual game. So. Of course, once I had enough of a game to play it, I decided, well, okay, you know the plan is to eventually sell this game to people. So I have to go find somebody to do the opposite. Right. All right, but I need somebody to draw all the pieces that go in the world and make it look like a serious game. And so I started doing this and it wasn't very easy. Thousand five or two thousand and six. Like there is today. Uh, there may be some people who made casual games on PC about like matching colored balls or something, but those are you know you know. Artist who who is good and in the mainstream ad now they are old and. Not like a professional 3D artist would quit his high paying job at a big company to work on something that looks like this nobody will ever care about. So it was actually very hard to find artists for this game. Uh but I went around. Artist hang out. I'm looking for someone to do art for this game. If you would like to apply for the job. Here is what we do will send you a screen shot of the game. It was different scenes various times. So i'll pay you for two days of your time and it's four days of what your style will look like in this game. Here is some high level art direction. Like the game is colorful. The foreground and background are very distinct and gave the rules like that. But generally, generally it was up to them because I want to see their style. Uh we bring to the game, you know I didn't. Send me a very long EMAIL and reply after having had a good game for a couple of days. And I got this on november 2, the day before my birthday when I was sitting down and getting ready to have a nice birthday. And here's what he said. This is going to be a little long but I am going to read it. This is actually it was way longer artist to create imagery around. Thank you. But also being a game player, it's hard not to anyone who played a the first cigarette on the consoles got tired. So interesting effects on the. Chapter three for to say that I am disappointed is. Good work for a game. That would be cool enough to get noticed. Ok. So I'm being really honest. Apologies forgiving. Right. This level of game cannot keep in touch in a children's game with children's themes. Such as having a 1 word description of the action between levels. I also suggest that you give the player a limited number of lives. The player is starting power of extra lives. They have an adventure in her face. The time rewind thing, maybe a program in the development process. But I find it. Perhaps a time rewind token can be collected and used occasionally by the player collecting tokens and power UPS is absolutely. For more than three screens willing to work if you're still interested. No, I can't see you can find a project like this as I can't see how you can make money. Is especially you know. Sometimes, um, you know and this was one of the first time uh I showed the game to some friends like i'll talk about later. But this is the first time i've shown it to. He was a gamer and I was very offended by my game. Um, but that wasn't really so. There is an interesting point to make here, which is that every single one of the core ideas behind the game that I went. This guy explicitly rejected and said something negative about right. Um, and it seems like he may be understood that some of those were the point of the game and maybe not less. Uh, he commented on the wind being a big thing in like somehow the fact that. This guy. And in fact, you can imagine there was some image forming in his head. Language like my son or whatever. And apologies. But the game industry is not forgiving. Someone who's on the same level as you. Right. So he was like picturing me so confused. I just didn't know what was going on now. One time there was lots of things like this. That was the worst one. There were several. So when the. Um, we did this audition process and I like what he did. We definitely would have needed to develop more concepts for the rest of the game. But it was good enough that I said, you know let's give this a try. You've got the job apply for. Hey, you got the job. Do you want to start the season in eastern europe somewhere house um, but the funny thing is just six weeks ago I was in the czech republic. I dropped out of doing your game. I just didn't understand what what you want? It just seems very confusing. And it didn't seem like a good opportunity for me. Biggest mistake of my career. Ha ha ha. I can maybe a little bit. It wasn't all negative. So around 2006, uh, I submitted the game to the independent games festival, which has been running for some years and I was like, you know but. National day. Is who are also video game developers. And none of them noticed game. The one that was great. That was like, all right, some official external mic. Um, nobody knew about this. Not it's not a famous thing but some people in the circles knew me because I gave conferences lectures a lot, but. It's on the backs of that. Um. Well, it's always very easy to underestimate how much time is left in development. So I thought there was about eight months left, 10 months left. So I wanted to start talking to people to try to publish it. Um, so Stephen had existed back then. It was very different than today. Us team back then. What the hell? We created storefront a game. And you will see triple a games. There has been a small number of. The same guy who was in charge of creating for the store. And I said here is the build of the game. Um this is together to polish this a lot before it's done, especially. And steam injected the game. And I had a phone conversation with the guy. And he said this game will sell less than 5000 copies on steam. 13 million users and not very many games. So he was really he was telling me like nobody. In the middle of you know in the run up of development I was paying attention to what was going on in the market in places like XBox live arcade which was the other place I was thinking of. XBox live arcade or selling between 100 and 200 thousand. 5000 very very, very very negative. Now this is all very strange because you know since the game to some friends very early on like when it was even. Start at the bottom. If you thought the earlier shot was ugly, like this is what the first version. Um, it was hard to see like the walls are too dark. This latter is literally something that I drew in photoshop. I like taking a brush, I don't know. One of my friends understood and enjoyed the game. Um, not universally there's maybe one person. And I was getting from all these other people and I just wasn't really sure why, right um but you know it's not good to give up easily. So I tried the back channel approach which was I had a friend who lives in seattle. Well, which is 16. Trust me. You know playing all the way through, talk about it and then see if we can sort of convince the steam curator that this is actually a really good game. Um, so we tried that. And uh. They have read it's like, oh, the game is too hard. The level design is um, and generally indie games don't sell nobody. For all you know these are obviously fundamental problem. If somebody is excited by the game, but they see a problem with it, they figure, well, we'll find a way to work around this or they'll give you the benefit of the doubt, like, oh, I you know I think maybe I don't like your level design a little bit, but that's. Having a positive. Even though they say. Negative attitude as related to my my friend and I talk to them but comments um, all this was happening. It was coming time for you. We can win game design. Recently. Seven. Once again, back then you were allowed to re submit your game. You can. No uh the problem. Forest game that much better a little better. Um no sound. What the level design I thought was really good at this point. So I submitted and uh not only. You know there were like six or seven games that everybody thought much more deserved to be game of the year than this one. Like I wasn't even sure that. Here before me just very exciting comments anyway, i've said a lot of things. I was showing you. Uh, he would pass the graphics and saw that it was an interest game and so on. It up understood. Um, and eventually we launched this summer vacation promotion and a lot of people play the game and really enjoyed it. And and from there to this wasn't even a cancel the game. Xbox live arcade at least once. And when they just sort of stopped answering my emails from silent like to cancel. Um, other stuff happened like. So I work with our outsourcing company. The time you. And got bigger customers. And so then I had like a game with like four levels that are in a style that nobody else was ever going to do. So now you know it's it's less painful for me to look back at this today. Defender is successful. And it's very simple. My game is good. And you know it's human to feel a little bit of that, but it's actually not constructive. And it doesn't make you better at making video games. Right? So the thing are you better at making video games is to look at all these examples of this game then it had a very good and why couldn't people see that the response was going to be that good? That's sort of the less. And so the observation I took out of that is just you know it's really hard for people to understand what your game is going to do if you're starting something, we're working on it. You may be in the middle is far the connections between all where it is. So maybe you see it being done. There is. And you'll see it maybe is being further sometimes when you see it or they won't even think of it that way. They'll think of this is the worst game. The more negative people's assessment is going to be because human beings very often work from examples. If something is similar to a thing that you've seen many times before, you understand it and you understand the potential of it like that. Something is just weird. We don't know what that is. We're not going to assume it's going to succeed because we haven't seen things like that succeed. Haven't seen things like that. So an extension of this. It is very important. For people to understand your game, even if that is their job that they're supposed to be a professional. So the steam guy and several other people that I left out of the story, um, it's their job to pick the good games and they saw this game and they were like this. You know at the same time, I think my friends did it. Now part of that might just be like, hey friends, you know so like maybe friend relationships make everything nicer or something, but I I think they gave the game a different kind of attention than a neutral person. And what would need to be to be a good game. You know they know me. They know that I work hard and they know that I would probably fill those gaps or something right or wrong. They know that this thing that I'm giving them is not a waste of their time. They're going to pay attention rental market for all he knows it could be a waste of space. So all of that was an answer to the first question. Um yeah question here's another one um games. In the open. You work on the development work on the game and you do the development just may be in secret for a long time. And then you release it and you try to get it. Anymore um when uh games on it. This early access more. Try to get it out in people's hands and and not just for. Good evening. See what they don't like. See how they react to your game and make designs. And this is a complex question because I think a lot of things, one of the things I think is like look feedback is good. The game is like and how well it works and how good the game is. Um, and seeing other people interact with your game can shatter any illusions that you have. And then you are in development. The more this is helpful experience to draw on. So you need this evidence from the world. But on the other hand, all that stuff I was saying about rain for 15 minutes three years taught me that people can what your game is going to be. So if you release something in early access. The feedback will be incorrect. The most positive thing. The feedback will be conservative. Is the closest understand and established himself. They say it should be more like that. And then you know if it gets worse than that, you could get guys who are like the first artist who are very, very negative. We certainly know that on the internet. Sure more reasons to be negative. Another question um. The witness being a larger team. What were the challenges in your collaborative process in order to make a game with multiple layers, often abstract ideas. Iteration can be very costly. This was also one of the Top questions in my mind when we started this. Brain was a much smaller game when you witness because there is nobody else on the project at the beginning. And I had this question, if we do a 3D game, that's labor intensive. And if the world is. How to make a personal feeling or game. We have a bigger team. A train craft commercial product itself personal and can we make a game with you or at least art's? Sorry, but I feel like it was successful. What we managed to do in terms of field and part of that is because I was thinking about this problem all the time. So I knew that we were going to make this game island where you can go anywhere is full of puzzles in different areas. Navigate to, we make a strong impression. And we're gonna do a lot of interesting things with reflections on color and all of those things, um, reference to each other in different ways to make a sort of a complicated knot, a string metal string tight across the island from place to place now, in answering the question about what the biggest his Challenge was really making sure that everybody on the team understood the game. Um, and just like i've been saying that it's hard for you know people at the store to understand the game. It's hard for players to understand your game. It's hard for people on your team to understand your game, um, especially at the beginning. So I have close ups of these pictures. What the game looked like pretty early on. I hadn't designed that many puzzles. So it was just like this single mesh, a little bit of water and some blocks and you can sort of walk everywhere. But it was very uncomfortable sometimes it was only playable. If you are very careful about what you consider playable, but uh. You know it was so it was enough to communicate. Ok, this is but the problem is is that a lot of the ideas behind the game were so these ideas were things about what the player understands. Or um, where player's attention is as they walk into an area and how we divert that surprising way sometimes and. I would say here some of the high level directors for the arts. It's a colorful art style with high contrast so that it's easy to recognize things and keen on details. There's not a lot of you use a high frequency texture details. So I gave a brick wall. Texture is the thing it creates a lot of a lot of needless detail cause noise. And so we will do something more like a very slight lines in it yeah anyway, I would say all this. But the game is so cool. See them stand now later by the time. Um, by the time you get here, you've tried a lot of things like, oh, here are our high level ideas of what art style should be. But wait a minute, leaves on the tree are very, very different from a wall. And do we need to generate different interpretations trees. And what about grace? There are many, many questions for years. And so over the course of the development of the game, we were building this understanding of what this really means to treat the players attention as precious in this space and create a very focused and you say that in the beginning. In development, you've seen a lot of examples. You've seen things that succeeded. You see things that failed. So you form a pattern in your mind of what really works. And by that, uh we're able to do things and they're good have to have a lot of back and forth. So I would say let's do a design for modeling. Good night for three or four times. And it was very tedious and time consuming. But it was because. We get closer and closer. But you know we never quite. No, what I just described was the situation with people like three artists and models. But when you have people. To make many of the structures on the island to design them and you know the initial measures for them, which we would then clean up. Are you doing. In general don't forget games all day. Work with. And so there was this extra wide gap in the game today, it was very important because they were tricky situations. We would have large structures like this one size. This is a doorway on the right hand side. House like this large areas and many puzzles within all of which had been locked in. Variations that the artist would understand the game player, the architects, we have to understand the constraints. Um, this happens all the time. People are. Making a video game on the team proceeding forward based on their understanding of what you're making and because everybody is different. So here's the game we're working on right now. Last week, I guess it's just a bunch of cubes. Figure out look so. To try it. Figure out the art style and here is in game notification. And it looks a lot better, right? And I would like something that people might actually buy on steam or somewhere. It's of course not done, but it's a good step. There is a problem. The problem is in this level I had some idea in my head about what was going on. There's like some platform, this guy, blue guy standing on and it's I mean it's all. So that it may be approved platform because it's got. Broken um, and these down here are really an excuse for like insert architectural reasons why this thing is standing up. No food onto the plate can drop down to the bottom floor. Ok. Mhm. Uh, so even though it looks like you might do something down here, it's really it's not supposed to be that interesting, right? It's just just a tiny little thing. So now one of the directors when we were trying to make the level look good with let's try to help. So that because we have these things floating in space like this. The background, you know this is floating in space more in the foreground. I would be easier to see here. And um well, you know her initial attempt was actually bring these out here, right? So that you can see you know you not only see this line up here on top, you see it on the bottom, you see this on the bottom. Your brain can maybe make more sense of where the squares are located in space, which is good. However, as a game designer. Immediately. And the reason is. Now this column is no longer on the left side of the world. Another sticker. We made a space behind it and you play a lot of blood pushing soccer games which this is. Um you know that as soon as you see a level, you start looking at details like that and trying to understand why they are important, right as a player need to walk through there. A red herring like a misleading mission to has been introduced in. Because that's just what happens when multiple people make games and problems. The problem is, you know, if you're making games with hundreds of levels is likely for this to happen. What can I do about that? So um. Sophia. The game director. Work has risen understanding. And this is another question, but they are similar. Putting them together, brainstorming and seeking references. We set a vision and concepts and have a clear style guidelines direction with me. But the artwork produced. For example, the costume designer. Good evening so far, what the game is about two people, um, I just got done saying it's hard to are you kidding me? Even for yourself, like just knowing when you look at something and you know that it's not good enough for you know that you're not sure what to do about that. And so. What do I do about it? Um, that wasn't the only one. You know my my personal favorite game design and it's pretty good. I recommend sometimes thinking about things this way to have this idea that everything in your game affects everything, not just in one level. Or if I look at. Good game. One character looks cooler than. People like that looks better than another. Looking back on a special game play. Um these things are quiet. But they mix together um, little by little, they make a very complex situation of interpreting things, right? I don't know. But an idea. I was very young. Is that art making. It's that if you're going to make a certain kind of thing. There are all these factors that affect how good is and your job making a. To produce the produce the most right a association humanly capable of doing. I don't know how it is here, but I think in the usa thrown away. About being 20 or you know just having new ideas in a gallery or something. And I think it's a shame. Things wrong with this idea something whether it's a level of. Most variable settings of the parameters are all pulling on each other. And. Approach a situation like this. So costume designs on the characters don't match the background. Um. There are two ways to attack this problem by attacking the elements of the problem. And one is by attacking the composition, right? Maybe you get the characters to match. Maybe you just get away to the right. Did you fire? Those are maybe you're not that maybe just give them a lot of time to develop. Might cost more money than you have. Maybe you get the background artist to paint over the characters are all existing. Um, which one? Um which it's not enjoyable at all. But if that's the thing you can do that you can do that. Um or you might be able to. If the designs of the characters don't match the background, maybe there is an opportunity that we can get from. Can we tweak the designs? This style. But can we draw some value out of the fact? Can we can we bring the games? That's the job of an art director really even on triple a games with very large budgets, people's art styles don't totally match like very often and the more experience you have in games, the more you can look at one of those things is and tell the person who modeled this thing. Coming up next week and art directors of really big games. Um just have developed the skill of being able to live with that fact reality and make it come out good. But going back to this question then, you know when we make our work. But it just never seems to be as good as we want we do about that. The first thing, like I said before, some artists are just better than others sometimes, but we all know we all know that. 10 minutes value judgment on the person, right? Because people get better. So. Again I think it's the u s we have you know how it is here, but at a point now where we met can say something. Because we say it's all relative, it's complicated. There's all these factors. And that's true also. So the so for example, you might have none. The thing. Artist but maybe not a good artist. Um but. In practice. So if you're starting to make a game, it's got its own style. Actually, there are no artists who are good at that style. Process that people need to practice working on the style of your game and get better at it. So from from that state, baby from the relative perspective. End up there a lot. And so then what do your best to just try to give everybody figure out the game. How do you do that? Well, you can do lots of generation. You talk about what's working, what's not working and you have to do. Don't really understand. He was working on this area for witnesses. You know this our rule was designed to help with the player's attention to. And the way this thing is colored and we can have that discussion and they say, oh yeah, I get. Um and then because we are human understand and Complete. I understand more. There is still a big gap and it just has to happen over and for me person. Um, so I get very frustrated with this, but I'm doing my best to just be kind and understand that this is the reality of the situation as it is, it's hard to make these games. It's hard for us to understand what's in each other's head and even knowing that. *** you. And we just keep working on it. Maybe that's why games take a million years to make. Visual artist working on your game style. Um, it it doesn't work again in lesson. What's on? Back to this perspective of the right making of things. You can view. This is one of those elements actually too much of a break. It's not that simple. And those elements, when they combine, can I self strengthening. And so we can I said so sad I think so freaking is a better term. So when you're, will it be okay if some stuff doesn't work? I wish it was better. We have limited time and energy. The Challenge is to make beautiful. I I should go to sleep. My artist name sorry. It's a very famous painting about a bunch of people. Shit just to see the curve the sail and the light plays on a really good. On. But I was there looking at this painting and one of the characters just some flowers and one of them was terrible. It was like he went made a little thing. This flower just looks. So uh but. Fine. Like it didn't ruin the painting. The painting was so beautiful. And so I think we're all in that position. You know there are things, there are things in there. Number. They can never be perfect. And so our Challenge is to take those elements in composing. So another question. How do you gain a level of confidence in a video game? So by the players. Uh, what's the camera every time? This is your job communicating with the players. You know it's interesting. Do they know it's interesting. Another question when making a reasonably good. Never give up current reality games to sell nowadays, the emphasis is on the sales will probably decide the lifespan. Bad is bad. Saying if a developer makes it truly. I think this is. Think about. Uh but I think a lot of people are concerned with this basic question today. Um. To a point like I would not encourage people not to think about how it works, how people will be excited by it, because that's the basic story. If you go to. About how do I get people to buy my game and the reality I mean making a mobile game, I guess the. Of the games. Um, so lucas, how to figure it out, though? If you look at his games, especially the two most famous ones papers, please, nobody in terms of communicating that there's something going on. Right? This is the. Um, on the one hand on the other. And it's very coherent. It's got things happening. Opening. That's not like any other game that you've seen. This is a very striking image. It's not like any other game that you see. It also didn't cost billions of dollars and thousands of people to make. Right. So Lucas, something out. Um, and the problem with following him. About the same things that he has about making your game noticeable. Once again, people will buy you may be wrong. Ok. But so so like I said, don't. Then you end up making the same games as everybody else. Because so many other people are just worrying about what you do when you worry about that. You say I'm going to design and build the thing that's going to have the high. That's what everybody else is. And so you end up making your situation worse. With your game that looks just like 15 other games is actually the one that they want. That's hard. So it's hard. It's hard if you're just trying to be a commercial clean game and it's hard. But I just don't panic about it. Right, right. Thanks in their hard times. We closed the car. Because I worked really hard on things program. But he was it was a learning experience. My brain and so even though that company went out of business, it was not a waste of time. Right? Whereas if you do. What else is going on here? Take two years and work hard late hours comes out. Nobody buys. Maybe doing boring things. That's my biggest advice is don't do that other human species has way too many people. And so the Challenge the call that I have. Hanging fruit and say somebody else will get that. It's fine. I'm gonna go out there, look for the fruit that nobody. Willing to do that. And the last question. Can't imagine it's so fast and frequently as a new car. Mhm. What should I do? Well, the way I think about this distinguish carefully between knowledge, knowledge, like trivia and knowledge. So knowledge that its surface stuff like unity added a new check box over here that will turn on an effect on the shoulder if you enable it. But it doesn't totally work well in the shadow opacity turn off shadow casting. Those engines are full of that kind of stuff. And to some degree, you do need to know them to get work done seriously or five years or some number of years knowledge that will matter always for all the by the time it'll be close enough to something else. It seems like you know our 3D objects represented, right? How what happens when the pixels get drawn on the screen? What is the shader in the first place? And why why is that is the sugar that way. Why isn't there just like what how what happened in the player's mind, when they walk up and start to solve a puzzle, they will make you better. And. They will make you more equipped to be one of the people into the unknown so that is everything. Questions yeah OK.

 You mentioned that um, it's hard for people to understand. Again, you can mention that even if they're on tv. And then you also say that it's good that people can understand what game should become a new comer? Because of me um communicating with art style things out. So this essentially means that the. Team beyond me a more comfortable advice on how to minimize. Well. I'm not sure that I'm actually the best person at that process right of having meetings annoys me, you know talking to people about working with me. And so it's taken me a long time. Is good. The people in this room um. I think the problem is that I think that the correct advice to. It's a joke really. You just have to understand. The best, which is not very well, what the other person's viewpoint is. You know what what they might understand about the game now and what they might not understand, never even thought. Um, save a lot of time. But what exactly. I know you are very thoughtful as always. What makes you think. Very important is to explore new territory. The low hanging fruit I heard in your other calls, as you say, what how to use the game media. I mean, how how could we have a direction? Can you point us out the direction of uh starting the new territory because I knew you had to say something like that. Do something nice to do, but is. The game with the the psychology for example. Please the media or you think this is maybe. Only game you can do. To the point I mean ascii. Is people will explore in different directions based on their own personal style. Somebody else like you would go and do something very different from what I was. See we get much richer results and the media will develop more strongly in that case. Um. So if you have an idea about psychology, that's not even an area where I have much of an education. So I can. In a formal way. What are you doing? So. Do you try and sometimes that's hard. Right sometimes I have this vague idea, but I don't know what's a good game and that's just the word that the work that we do. So uh I wish you good luck in that, but. Thank you very much. I'm dying. First of all. Thanks for this. My question is from a would you recommend new comers? What would you like. For calling bye. Three function by um. Do you get experience best? And that probably means something like community. What you want is experience program and then maybe. Maybe we can start forgetting it for a little bit. The problem. So the engines like that appealing at first things on the screen very fast. Something very challenging and very specific, whatever you can speak great deal of trying to deal with that and then be sad. It is the problem clear, however. Something that hard. So I would say for new people it's you know to use those things. If you're established. It's often a good idea to well, it's my personal style. You know I I like using bass note. Very special. Like I can just go change the way the core works if that's gonna be better for the game. And you can't really do that if you do it control it. Yeah, I mean if you're if you're excited about games and you're new to it, by all means use those engines just before thinking about the long term. I always encourage. Think about the long term in 10 years, maybe every year. Oh my. How we can in no way can we learn the so called knowledge. Well, it's a little bit difficult to say because. Oh yeah. We sort of have to decide what we think is the the rules of are not going to tell us what deep about games, you know on the other hand, to decide anything could decide this stupid thing. So. For me, it's just a feeling that i've developed over time. That might be a good idea for a species to figure out. Really hard to draw the distinction. What I would say though is it's useful if you don't know what is in which category. It's useful to look at and just think about. It's random. How are you? I'm sorry, it's me again. Into the wind. I'm finished. Um, but like when I first saw. It's all possible. I was like if I if I was a, how would this game? So then so this question kind of boils down to like how do you come up to the ultimate conclusion that you knew that all these ideas come together would make. Well. I mean, that's just the designer's job, right? I mean so. You should make games for yourself and things that you'll be excited about. And other people say you should make games for the market. Games that I'm excited about. So tell us about what's exciting, especially. Of course that's exciting. It's like it's like kid, is your son right to somebody else? He's just some guy and. Um but then you can sort of to me or is it exciting to people who like puzzle games? And it seemed like cakes. And there will be. You know one of the. High price for an independent game was $40 US a. Everybody was like, oh my god, what is he doing setting the price that high? Could be a small set of people to get money from people. Right? And and so it might be that we made less money in the end. Um, I don't know, I can't run that experiment in another reality, but so I didn't. Hello. Another. What do you think about story and can't decide how to balance. Well, I don't like story. I'm sure it's the same here, but in the us so many people at conferences are like stories in games are amazing. Companies say we're going to find new ways to tell stories with technology. So I don't really I don't really work that way. And I encourage you to to do that. It's only my world. Wait for me. Um. And again, this is my personal. Uh but I focus. Ok. So there is a story is a word that means a lot or watch a movie on me. But there is a saying you know where it takes place. News of the a bunch of other things. Um really games are not that good at it. Something is interactive. So I think maybe we should research using those other elements of story. I don't like story. That's maybe even.
